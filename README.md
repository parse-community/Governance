# Governance
This document aims to set out the model by which the Parse Platform is governed & provide specific insight into how we make decisions, give permissions and responsibility and spend our Open Collective budget. We hope this aids the transparency within the Parse Community and both encourages & enables the people who depend on Parse Server & its SDKs to get involved to improve our offering for yourselves and everyone else in the community.

We have decided to loosely follow the [Meritocratic Governance Model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel), we may deviate from this model as set out by this document and we encourage proposals to improve our methods of governance.
