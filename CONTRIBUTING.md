# Contributing

We want to encourage any and all members of the community to contribute to the Parse Platform. In order for this to happen we want everyone to feel comfortable and able to join in with the community.

## Types of Contribution

The Parse Platform has many elements meaning that the range of contributions are varied in type, scope, time and complexity. Please do not feel that you must have a great level of skill or be making code level contributions to be valued, there are loads of things that need doing and we appreciate anyone who is willing to get involved

Below is a small list of the many possible ways to contribute in our community...
- Helping new users by answering questions on Stack Overflow ([parse-platform][stack-overflow-tag] tag) or our [community forum][community-forum]
- Triarging bugs on one of the 40+ Parse Platform GitHub repos
- Reporting and/or fixing bugs
- Reporting security vulnerabilities, see our [security policy][security-policy]
- Implementing new features
- Writing blog posts
- Managing our twitter account
- Improving our website
- Keeping docs up to date

## What we ask of you

We want to make contributing a stress and hassle free experience but due to this being a largely volunteer based community we ask that you follow these points...
- Please respect the time & effort of our PMC members and those reviewing PRs and interecting with issues
- We aim to start the review process on PRs within a few days but we ask that when making contributions you remain patient
- Disagreements will come up but community members must remian civil and adhere to our [code of conduct][code-of-conduct]
- If you aim to make a large contribution we suggest seeking a consensus that it will be accepted so that you don't waste your time
