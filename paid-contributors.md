# Parse Community Paid Contributors

## Overview

In an effort to maintain the quality and timely development of the Parse Platform, the Parse Community will pay a monthly stipend to contributors who have demonstrated a consistent, positive contribution to the community.

This is a pilot program whose effectiveness will be evaluated to determine if it should be continued.

The goal is to compensate individual contributors for whom the payments will be a material incentive to enable them to continue their contributions.

Initially, the project management committee will determine by vote who will be eligible for a stipend.  A monthly amount will be agreed to and voted on by the project management committee. Voting will take place publicly on our [community forum](https://community.parseplatform.org) . The number of core contributors receiving funds must be less than a majority of the members.

Each month the recipient will submit a payment request to our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/parse-server) for review and approval.  The payment request should include a brief summary of the months activities to make transparency easy for any observer. Payment requests submitted without having been approved for the program will be denied.
